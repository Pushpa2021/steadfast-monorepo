ðŸ‘‰ All these basic operations now work well for both brokers:

- âœ… kill switch
- âœ… buy/sell
- âœ… cancel orders
- âœ… place limit/market
- âœ… select strikes
- âœ… close all positions

#### Note:

kill switch works on client side only, you will still be able to trade from your broker terminal.
